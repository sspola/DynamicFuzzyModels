# Dynamic Fuzzy Models

This repository contains a collection of dynamic fuzzy models (DFMs) and related analysis scripts.
The aim of this repository is to showcase and share published DFMs, to ensure reproducibility of results and facilitate model improvements.
If you wish to have more information about DFMs, their definition, and simulation, please check:

## Model implementation
The DFMs contained in this repository are implemented by means of [Simpful](https://github.com/aresio/simpful), a user-friendly python library for fuzzy logic.
